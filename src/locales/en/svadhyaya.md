# Ánanda Váńii (59, 60, 61)

**(59)**

The more the honest people are firm on morality, the more the evil forces will be active against them.

So all the moralists of the universe should remain organized and confront the evil forces unitedly.

Human society is one and indivisible.

Keeping this supreme truth ever fixed in oneʼs vision, one will have to think of promoting human welfare, love for humanity, human solidarity and universal fraternity, and move accordingly. Not for a single moment should one forget it nor even ignore it. Due to lack of intellect or mutual conflicts in the past, a vast number of creatures have become totally extinct from the surface of the earth.

Let human beings not meet the same dreadful consequence.

**(61)**

Human history today has reached such a transitional phase that universal humanity, forgetting all spatial, temporal and personal differences, shall have to move, hand in hand, shoulder to shoulder towards the new dawn with rapid steps.

Humanity must respond to this call. With the reddish glow of the dawn, the collective body, mind and soul will be radiant with joy.

And that alone will be the real progress of universal humanity, the firm establishment of unified humanism.
