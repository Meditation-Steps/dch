> Human beings will have to draw up all sorts of plans and programmes for the collective welfare of universal humanity.
>
> This will accelerate the speed of their movement and enable them to easily remove the thorns from the path.
>
> Obstacles are inevitable on the path of movement.
>
> In fact, in all actions, auspicious and inauspicious, obstacles arise, but the innate force lying in each thought and every action, from the cosmic perspective, provides the necessary stamina for forward movement.
>
> Let us not forget this fact.

> That very irresistible aspiration which leads human beings towards their goal with tremendous speed, also builds all sorts of social structures and generates newer social consciousness.
>
> With all sincerity in thought, words and deeds you have to build that aspiration, you have to awaken the cognitive faculty latent in the innermost golden cavity of every microcosmic mind.
>
> For you have to work to bring about the well-being of every entity; no benevolent individual can neglect anyone.

> All the entities of the universe are on the move. No one has come to rest, to lament unnecessarily.
>
> And in this movement lies the success of every entity, the colourful glamour of oneʼs existence.
>
> So move on individually, move on collectively.
>
> Let your sincere help illuminate those who have lagged behind on the path of movement.
